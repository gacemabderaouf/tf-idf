Deep learning enables many applications, which invariably consist of taking data in
some form, such as images or text, and producing data in another form, such as
labels, numbers, or more text. Taken from this angle, deep learning consists of
building a system that can transform data from one representation to another. This
transformation is driven by extracting commonalities from a series of examples that
demonstrate the desired mapping. The system might note the general shape of a
dog and the typical colors of a golden retriever, for example. By combining the two
image properties, the system can correctly map images with a given shape and color
to the golden-retriever label instead of a black lab (or a tawny tomcat, for that matter). The resulting system can consume broad swaths of similar inputs and produce
meaningful output for those inputs.
The first step of this process is converting the input into floating-point numbers,
as you see in the first step of figure 2.1 (along with many other types of data).
