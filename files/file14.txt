Using Jupyter Notebooks
We’re going to assume that you have PyTorch and the other dependencies installed
and have verified that things are working. We’re going to be making heavy use of Jupyter Notebooks for example code. A Jupyter Notebook shows itself as a page in the
browser through which you can run code interactively. The code gets evaluated by a
kernel, a process running on a server that’s ready to receive code to execute and send
back the results, which are rendered inline on the page. A notebook maintains the
state of the kernel, such as variables defined during the evaluation of code, in memory
until it’s terminated or restarted. The fundamental unit with which you interact with a
notebook is a cell, a box on the page where you can type code and have the kernel
evaluate it (by choosing the menu item or pressing Shift-Enter). You can add multiple
cells to a notebook, and the new cells see the variables you created in the earlier cells.
The value returned by the last line of a cell is printed below the cell after execution,
and the same goes for plots. By mixing source code, results of evaluations, and Markdown-formatted text cells, you can generate beautiful interactive documents. You can
