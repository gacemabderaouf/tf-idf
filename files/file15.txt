Introducing deep learning and the PyTorch library

At this point, you’ll need to start the notebook server from the root directory of
the code checkout from GitHub. How starting the server looks depends on the details
of your operating system and on how and where you installed Jupyter. If you have
questions, feel free to ask on our forums.7 When the notebook server starts, your
default browser pops up, showing a list of local notebook files.
Jupyter Notebooks are powerful tools for expressing and investigating ideas
through code. Although we think that they make a good fit with our use case, they’re
not for everyone. We would argue that it’s important to focus on removing friction
and minimizing cognitive overhead, which is going to be different for everyone. Use
what you like during your experimentation with PyTorch.
