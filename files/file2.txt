Though we stress the practical applications, we also believe that providing an
accessible introduction to foundational deep learning tools like PyTorch is more than
a way to facilitate the acquisition of new technical skills. It is also a step toward equipping a new generation of scientists, engineers, and practitioners from a wide range of
disciplines with a working knowledge of the tools that will be the backbone of many
software projects during the decades to come.
To get the most out of this book, you need two things:
Some experience programming in Python—We’re not going to pull any punches on
that one: you’ll need to be up on Python data types, classes, floating-point numbers, and the like.
Willingness to dive in and get your hands dirty—It’ll be much easier for you to learn
if you follow along with us.
Deep learning is a huge space. In this book, we’ll be covering a tiny part of that
space—specifically, using PyTorch for smaller-scope projects. Most of the motivating
examples use image processing of 2D and 3D data sets. We focus on practical PyTorch,
with the aim of covering enough ground to allow you to solve realistic problems with
deep learning or explore new models as they pop up in research literature. A great
resource for the latest publications related to deep learning research is the ArXiV
public preprint repository, hosted at https://arxiv.org.1
